# 2310 Lecture Demos

2021 UPDATE: Although the class is over, should anyone stumble upon this repository as an educator, you can find a brief guide for using these modules in-class, by going from starter to completed code along with your students during class, [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SDLx8A5SzNQNteSCqG8pGBy6mQ403b2Cs9hOTWFQt7w/edit?usp=sharing).

This is a small Unity 2020 project featuring demo scenes illustrating basic computer animation concepts. This repository will be updated in advance of every lecture with a "Starter" folder containing everything you will need to get started with that class' example. I will be coding live during the class, starting from the contents of the "Starter" folder. You can follow along during class to finish the example, learning how to implement relevant concepts along the way.

## Quick Start for Students

Clone this repository with Sourcetree/your Git client of choice. Make sure to pull before every lecture so you can have the latest updates and starter content for that session's content. You should open the project on your own and familiarize yourself/poke around before class if you have time. If you're feeling very ambitious, some weeks will have hints as to what you need to do in any starter scripts included - so you could even try working on the examples yourself before class.

## Project Structure

The Unity Assets folder contains a number of modules, each representing a different in-class example. Modules are **not** standalone, as some will re-use scripts first developed in previous examples. Scripts are organized in this way to make it easier for you to follow along in class (every "working script" for that example being in a single folder). 

Each module features a "Starter" folder, with a scene and scripts representing the basis for an in-class practical example. After class, a "Completed" folder will be added to the module containing a finished version of the exercise, with a completed scene and "finished" versions of the scripts. If you are unable to get an example working during class, or you miss a lecture, you can check out the "Completed" folder to see it in action and reference the code for your own future work.
